# Project title

#### David Havrilla, Nicole Lincoln, Josh White
**Vision statement:** Organize your resumes and job search materials  
**Motivation:** Since we are all searching for jobs, we would like to have a central resource for all of our resumes, cover letters, skill descriptions, potential companies, and job postings.   
**Risks to project completion:** 
+ Potentially overambitious with too many desired features
+ Unfamiliarity with tools (Django)
+ Time constraits with other classes, jobs, etc. 

**Mitigation Strategy:**
+ Have a baseline deliverable product that does not contain every feature desired
+ Once a week meetings to discuss project features, delays, issues (scrum meetings), plus continual contact through Slack channel 
+ Sharing helpful resources and tutorials on tools that we find 

**Development method:** Scrum. Weekly scrums (zoom meeting), intermittent Slack updates with progress

**Project Tracking Software:** Trello
